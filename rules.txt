üêæ Pok√©mon ‚Üí D&D Conversion Rules (Option A System)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Level Conversion
‚Ä¢ 1 D&D level = 5 Pok√©mon levels
‚Ä¢ D&D Level = ceil(Pok√©mon Level √∑ 5)
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Pok√©mon Stats Conversion
Stats

Each Pok√©mon stat (Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) is converted into a D&D modifier:

(Pok√©mon Base Stat √∑ 10) + 5, rounded down.


Example: Pikachu Attack 55 ‚Üí (55 √∑ 10) + 5 = 10.

HP stays as it is from Pok√©mon stats.

Hit Dice System:

Pok√©mon gain extra HP per D&D level using a Hit Die based on their Base HP stat:

HP ‚â§ 50 ‚Üí d6

51‚Äì100 ‚Üí d8

101‚Äì150 ‚Üí d10

151+ ‚Üí d12

Note: All converted stats (Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) use standard D&D rules to calculate modifiers for rolls, AC, and saves:

Modifier = floor((Stat - 10)√∑2) 

Example: Speed 16 ‚Üí Modifier +3 ‚Üí used for AC, Initiative, and Speed-based saves.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Proficiency Bonus

‚Ä¢ At evolution, base HP is replaced by the new evolution‚Äôs base HP, then add Hit Dice for levels already gained
‚Ä¢ Moves and abilities from evolution are immediately available
