🐾 Pokémon → D&D Conversion Rules (Option A System, Updated with Move Tiers)
1️⃣ Level Conversion

1 D&D level = 5 Pokémon levels

D&D Level = ceil(Pokémon Level ÷ 5)

2️⃣ Pokémon Stats Conversion
Stats

Each Pokémon stat (Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) is converted into a D&D ability score:
(Pokémon Base Stat ÷ 10) + 5, rounded down.

Modifiers follow standard D&D rules:
Modifier = floor((Stat − 10) ÷ 2)

HP

Adjusted Base HP = floor(Pokémon Base HP ÷ 3)

At Level 1, Pokémon HP = Adjusted Base HP.

Each additional D&D level adds Hit Die value (average or rolled).

Hit Dice

Based on original (unscaled) Base HP:

HP ≤ 50 → d6

51–100 → d8

101–150 → d10

151+ → d12

Per level (average):

d6 → +4 HP

d8 → +5 HP

d10 → +6 HP

d12 → +7 HP

3️⃣ Proficiency Bonus

Follows standard D&D progression.

Added to moves/saves if proficient.

Natures

One stat gains Proficiency bonus.

One stat suffers Deficiency (−2 permanent penalty).

4️⃣ Evolution

Pokémon evolve at the equivalent D&D level:

D&D Level = floor(Pokémon Evolution Level ÷ 5)

At evolution:

Replace base stats with evolved form’s stats (recompute using formula).

HP resets to evolved form’s Adjusted HP, then add Hit Dice gained so far.

Moves and abilities from evolution are gained immediately.

5️⃣ Moves

Pokémon know all moves they’ve learned.

After a Long Rest, prepare 4 “energy” moves.

All other moves may be used freely at-will.

Move Learning

Pokémon Learn Level → divide by 5 (round down) = D&D Level.

Move Categories

Free Moves = 0 Energy Slots (basic, low-power).

Basic Moves = 1+ Energy Slot.

Power Moves = 2+ Energy Slots.

Ultimate Moves = 3+ Energy Slots.

Energy Slots

Pokémon are treated as Full Casters (Wizard/Cleric progression).

6️⃣ Move Tiers (0–5 System)

Moves are ranked into 6 tiers based on Power, PP, and effect.
This determines their D&D Energy Slot level (like spell levels).

🔹 Level 0 — Basic Moves

Power: 0–40

PP: High (30–40+)

Learned early (Lv 1–5 in Pokémon).

No Energy Slot cost (like cantrips).

Examples: Tackle, Scratch, Growl, Leer, Harden.

🔹 Level 1 — Standard Moves

Power: 41–60

PP: 20–30

Reliable “bread and butter” moves.

Examples: Ember, Vine Whip, Quick Attack, Wing Attack.

🔹 Level 2 — Strong Moves

Power: 61–80

PP: 15–25

Mid-tier staple attacks or strong buffs.

Examples: Body Slam, Thunder Punch, Confusion, Ice Punch.

🔹 Level 3 — Power Moves

Power: 81–100

PP: 10–15

Big damage or strong utility.

Examples: Flamethrower, Earthquake, Surf, Psychic.

🔹 Level 4 — Ultimate Moves

Power: 101–130

PP: 5–10

Rare, late-game finishers.

Examples: Fire Blast, Hydro Pump, Close Combat, Blizzard.

🔹 Level 5 — Legendary / Nuke Moves

Power: 131+ or unique, fight-defining effects.

PP: 1–5

Reserved for signature/legendary attacks.

Examples: Hyper Beam, Giga Impact, Draco Meteor, Fissure.

Status Moves

Weak/common status (Growl, Tail Whip, Sand Attack) → Level 0.

Strong buffs/debuffs (Swords Dance, Agility, Toxic, Recover) → Level 2–3.

Game-changing effects (Spore, Perish Song, Destiny Bond) → Level 4–5.

7️⃣ Combat Rolls

Attack Rolls

Physical: d20 + ATK + Proficiency vs Target AC

Special: d20 + Sp.Atk + Proficiency vs Target AC

Damage

Physical = Move Tier Power + ATK mod − Target DEF mod (min 1)

Special = Move Tier Power + Sp.Atk mod − Target Sp.Def mod (min 1)

(Optional scaling: Divide Pokémon Move Power by 10 for D&D balance. Ex: Flamethrower 90 → 9.)

Saving Throws

Physical effect → d20 + DEF mod + Prof

Special effect → d20 + Sp.Def mod + Prof

Reflex/Area/Quick → d20 + Speed mod + Prof

Initiative

d20 + Speed mod

AC / Dodge

10 + Speed mod (cap at +5)

8️⃣ Type System

STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus):

If a move matches one of the Pokémon’s types → add Proficiency bonus to damage.

Resistances & Weaknesses:

Resistance: damage × 0.5 (round down)

Weakness: damage × 2

9️⃣ Movement

Step 1 — Base Score:
D_Speed = floor(Pokémon_Speed ÷ 10 + 5)

Step 2 — Weight Modifier (kg):

Weight (kg)	Modifier
0–9.9	+1
10–49.9	0
50–149.9	−1
150–299.9	−2
300+	−3

Step 3 — Adjusted Movement Score:
Adj_Movement = max(1, D_Speed + WeightMod)

Step 4 — Convert to Feet:
Movement = round_to_nearest_5(Adj_Movement × 2.5)
